The shell, a fundamental part of Linux operating systems, allows users to manage their systems through the terminal on various distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentoOS, SUSE...

** Kernel ->
The kernel is like the brain of a computer; it resides at the heart of the operating system and is responsible for managing all activities within the system.

 The kernel manages a set of critical resources that are the building blocks of the Linux operating system:

- Organization and accessibility of files,
- Initialization, management, and termination of processes,
- Handling of input and output operations,
- Efficient use of memory,
- Communication between various devices.

  Like an orchestra conductor, these tasks ensure the system works in harmony and that the computer performs many complex functions in an organized manner.

** Shell ->
  The shell is an important tool that allows a user to interact with the operating system. It serves as a bridge between you and the computer's kernel, understanding your language and converting your instructions into a format the computer can understand.

   Commands entered from the keyboard or instructions taken from files are made comprehensible to the operating system through the shell.

   It automatically comes into action when a user opens a terminal or logs into their computer.

* Command-Line Shell
This type of shell allows users to interact with the operating system using text-based commands. Commands are entered via the keyboard and enable the execution of various tasks and operations.

Commands are given through a "Terminal" application on Linux or macOS, and through the "Command Prompt" on Windows. Users can list files (ls), view file contents (cat), and perform many other tasks

** Terminal
The terminal opens a window to use the shell in your computer's operating system and is a powerful program that allows direct dialogue with the system.

Essentially, it enables users to enter written commands and see the results of these commands through a text-based interface.

The difference between a terminal and a shell; the shell is the background engine that processes commands, while the terminal is the interface that allows you to interact with this engine.
